         Timket has been celebrated in Ethiopia for many centuries, tracing its roots back to ancient times. 
        It is said to have originated from the biblical account of the baptism of Jesus by John the Baptist.

        The celebration of Timket begins on the eve of the festival with a procession, where the replicas of the Tabot 
      (Ark of the Covenant) are taken from the churches and placed on temporary altars. On the day of Timket, a reenactment of the baptism of Jesus
       takes place, where the faithful are blessed with holy water. The festival is characterized by singing, dancing, feasting, and processions. 
       People dressed in traditional white clothing and carrying crosses, candles, and umbrellas participate in the procession.
       The festival concludes with the return of the Tabot replicas to the churches..
