      Ethiopia, in the Horn of Africa, is a rugged, landlocked country split by the Great Rift Valley. 
      With archaeological finds dating  back more than 3 million years, it’s a place of ancient culture. 
      Among its important sites are Lalibela with its rock-cut Christian churches from the 12th–13th centuries. 
      Aksum is the ruins of an ancient city with obelisks, tombs, castles and Our Lady Mary of Zion church.

     <p align="justify">
        Our Beginning, The area now known as Ethiopia is thought by many scholars to be the region where early 
        Homo sapiens first emerged in the middle Palaeolithic period about 150 – 200,000 years ago.The oldest 
        hominid fossils ever discovered were found in Ethiopia in 1994 and date from 4.2m years ago and are known
        as “Ardi” (Ardipithicus ramidus). The more well-known fossil remains of “Lucy” (Australopithecus afarensis) 
        date from 3.2 m years ago and were discovered in 1974.The oldest stone tools ever discovered anywhere in the
        world were found in 2010 and dated at 3 m years old. Fossilised animal bones with stone tool inflicted marks
        have also been found in Ethiopia dating from 3.4 m years ago.Contacts with Ancient Egypt Ethiopia is believed
        by many scholars to be the ‘Land of Punt’ described by Egyptian chroniclers as a trading partner from over 5,000
        years ago. Myrrh, ivory, animal skins and gold were imported from Punt. This trade followed routes along the Nile 
        and the Red Sea coast. </p>

        <p align = "justify">
        Pre-Axumite Yeha
        The kingdom of D’mt with its capital at Yeha was the first kingdom known to have existed 
        and dates from around the 10th century BCE (equivalent to BC, Before the Common/Current Era). 
        A Sabean style temple was built there around 800 BCE and is the oldest standing structure 
        in sub-Saharan Africa. Scholars associate Sabean culture with the area that is modern day
        Yemen.</p>
          <p align = "justify">
        Axumite Empire
        The D’mt kingdom was succeeded by the Axumite Empire around the 1st century BCE with 
        some scholars placing its origin around 400 BCE. Persian writer Mani (216 – 274 CE) 
        listed Axum with Rome, Persia and China as the 4 great powers of his era. </p> <br>
        <p align = "justify"> 
        Christianity was introduced by Frumentius in 330 CE. Frumentius, who was born in Syria, 
        converted Axumite King Ezana in 356 CE. Under Ezana and his son Kaleb, 
        the Axumite Empire was at its peak and growing rich and powerful from trade routes 
        linking India and ancient Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean with the Byzantine 
        Empire in the Mediterranean Sea. Its territories extended from modern Somalia
        and the Indian Ocean coast, across the Red Sea to the southern Arabian Peninsula and 
        north up to the border with the Roman Empire in Egypt. </p>
        <p align = "justify"> 
        Near the end of the 5th century CE a group of missionary monks known as the Nine Saints 
        rrived from Syria, Greece and Constantinople. They had a huge influence on the history 
        and culture of Ethiopia and the development of Orthodox Christianity in the centuries 
        that followed. </p>
          <p align = "justify">
        The last Axumite coins were minted in the 7th century CE. The reasons for the empire’s 
        fall are not clear. It has been attributed to a persistent drought, overgrazing, 
        deforestation, plague or a shift in trade routes. </p>
            <p align = "justify">
        Ethiopian Middle Ages – Zagwe Dynasty (900 – 1270)
        The Zagwe dynasty was based around Lalibela, the city of rock hewn churches that now 
        bears the name of this dynasty’s most famous king. Much is still unknown about this period. </p>
          <p align="justify"> 
        Early Solomonic Period (1270 – 1529) Yekuno Amlak deposed the last of the Zagwe kings, married 
        his daughter and established a dynasty of kings claiming legitimacy as male-line of descendants
        of the Axumite kings and therefore continuing the Solomonic line from Solomon and Sheba.In this
        period Ethiopia again expanded militarily to dominate the Horn of Africa. The arts and literature
        also advanced despite the lack of a fixed capital as emperors continually moved around the empire
        in mobile camps.</p>
            <p align = "justify"> 
        Portuguese missions to Ethiopia started from the 15th century. There had for many years The Portuguese
        Influence been a legend in Europe of a Christian king in the far east known as Prester John. Various 
        expeditions had been sent to find him. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        Pero da Covilha arrived on such a mission in 1490. He remained until 1507 when the 
        Regent Queen Eleni sent a request to the King of Portugal for military support against 
        the Muslim armies to the east. In 1520 a Portuguese fleet arrived in the Red Sea and met 
        with Emperor Lebna Dengel remaining in Ethiopia for about 6 years. Father Francisco 
        Alvares (1465 - 1541) was a member of this delegation. He travelled widely 
        and wrote the first western accounts of Ethiopia. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        The Abyssinian – Adal War (1529 – 1543)
        From 1528 – 1540 Muslim armies from the Sultanate of Adal in the southeast over ran three 
        quarters of the Abyssinian kingdom. Their leader was known as Mohammed Gran (Mohammed 
        the left handed). From hiding, the Ethiopian emperor appealed to the Portuguese for help. 
        A Portuguese fleet arrived from India in 1541 with 400 musketeers. About two years later 
        Mohammed Gran was killed in battle and his forces were routed. The Portuguese then put 
        pressure on the Ethiopian king to publicly profess allegiance to the Pope in Rome. 
        The emperor refused. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Early Gondar Period (1632 – 1769)
        In the years that followed the defeat of Mohammed Gran, the Portuguese steadily increased 
        their influence and power until the conversion to Roman Catholicism of Emperor Susenyos 
        (1572 – 1632) in 1622. This resulted in a period of violence and open rebellion against 
        the new religion. Susenyos eventually abdicated in favour of his son Fasilides who reinstated 
        the Orthodox faith as the state religion and expelled the Portuguese Jesuit priests. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
        Emperor Fasilides established Gondar as Ethiopia’s third permanent capital after Axum 
        and Lalibela in 1636.In this period, each king after Fasil including Queen Mentawab, 
        built a fortified castle residence in what is now referred to as Fasil Ghebbi which 
        loosely translates as Fasil’s compound. This is why Gondar is sometimes called ‘The 
        Camelot of Africa’. A wall with 12 gates surrounds this Royal Enclosure.
        Gondar was the capital for the next two centuries until, upon his coronation, 
        Emperor Tewedros II moved the capital to his fortress at Maqdala in 1855. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Zemene Mesafint – ‘Age of the Princes’ (1769 – 1855)
        This was a period of great instability and division when a succession of 23 Emperors held 
        the throne. There was no powerful central authority uniting and controlling the warring 
        princes and provincial kings who continuously fought each other. They competed to extend 
        their own lands at each other’s expense and be seen as the guardians of whoever was the 
        current, but nominal, King of Kings enthroned at Gondar. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
        This period ended in 1855 with the coronation of Tewedros II (b. 1818 – 1868) after he 
        militarily defeated all his rival princes. Full imperial power was once again in the 
        hands of one leader and the history of modern Ethiopia began. </p>

       <p align = "justify">
        Modern Period (1855 – 1936)
        The reigns of Emperors Tewedros II (reigned 1855 – 68), Yohannes IV (r. 1872 – 1889) 
        and Menelik II (r. 1889 – 1913) were during a period when Ethiopia started to open up 
        to the world. </p>

        <p align = "justify">
        Tewedros II (r. 1855 – 1868)
        Despite resistance from some provincial leaders, Tewedros II started to modernise and 
        entralise imperial administration. After writing to Queen Victoria and other European 
        imperial leaders but not receiving a reply Tewedros felt insulted and took some 
        Europeans hostage. This ended very badly in 1868 when the British sent a huge military 
        expedition of 13,000 soldiers, 26,000 men for logistical support and 40,000 animals 
        including war elephants from India. This expedition was led by General Napier (1810 – 1890). 
        Their 280 sail and steam ships landed on the Red Sea coast and a road was built into the 
        interior. Elephants hauled heavy artillery up into the mountains from the coastal plain. 
        It took 3 months to trek the 640 km to the mountain top fortress at Maqdala

        Tewedros’ last minute offer to return the hostages with a peace offering of large 
        numbers of cattle and sheep was rejected by Napier who wanted Tewedros’ full surrender. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
        When all was obviously lost, rather than surrender to the British who had been secretly 
        supported along the expedition route by rebellious princes who sought his throne, 
        Tewedros shot himself with a pistol given to him by Queen Victoria. Maqdala was 
        looted and Tewedros son was taken by the British to London. There, he was known as 
        Prince Alemayu of Abyssinia and he came under the protection of Queen Victoria. 
        He was sent to the prestigious Rugby public school and even enrolled at Royal 
        Sandhurst Military Academy but died, aged 18, in 1879. To this day there is a 
        brass plaque in his memory at the royal chapel in Windsor.

        Tewedros II is considered a great national hero by Ethiopians. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
        Yohannes IV (r. 1872 – 1889)
        The reign of Emperor Yohannes IV (b. 1837 – 1889) was dominated by war with Egypt 
        and the Mahdists of Sudan. It was also a time of increasing engagement with European 
        powers especially Italy who, through a series of land purchases and treaties, 
        established a colony on the Red Sea coast in what is now Eritrea. Yohannes was 
        killed by a stray bullet in a battle in which his forces were victorious against 
        the Mahdists in 1889. This prompted King Sahle Maryam of Shewa to declare himself 
        Emperor Menelik II of Ethiopia. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Menelik II (r. 1889 – 1913)
        Menelik’s reign (b. 1844 – 1913) saw the empire expand to the south, west and 
        east by conquest and negotiation. In 1889 he signed the Treaty of Wuchale with 
        the Italians but the Italians secretly changed the Italian language version. 
        On discovering this trickery, Menelik demanded the Italians change the key 
        clauses. The Italians refused and invaded Ethiopia from their coastal colony in Eritrea. 
        The Italian army was destroyed at the Battle of Adwa in 1896. Victory at Adwa Day 
        is a national holiday celebrated on 2 March (European calendar). It was the first 
        time an African army had defeated a European colonial invasion in open battle. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        Menelik II is considered the Father of Modern Ethiopia. He built diplomatic relations 
        with European powers including, notably, Russia. He encouraged modernisation and 
        development including the Djibouti to Addis Ababa railway line built by the French. 
        He established the first bank and postal system and brought electricity to the new 
        capital which he founded and named Addis Ababa, meaning New Flower. Under his reign 
        the first telephone and telegraph service was set up and the first cars were seen in 
        Ethiopia. </p>
      <p align = "justify">
        Menelik’s death in 1913 was followed by a period of intrigue and plotting at the royal court. 
        Menelik’s unpopular grandson Iyasu V who succeeded him was deposed by the nobles in 1916. 
        He was followed by Menelik’s daughter Empress Zewditu and her cousin Ras Tafari Makonnen 
        who became regent. (Ras can translate as head, Duke or Lord). Ras Tafari Makonnen succeeded 
        to the throne in 1930 and changed his name to Haile Selassie I. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Haile Selassie I (r. 1930 – 1974)
        His full royal title was “His Imperial Majesty Haile Selassie I, Conquering Lion of the 
        Tribe of Judah, King of Kings of Ethiopia and Elect of God”. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        Having been regent from 1916, Haile Selassie (b. 1892 – 1975) was crowned as Emperor in 1930. 
        He went into exile after the initially successful fascist Italian invasion of 1935. 
        In his appeal for help to The League of Nations he famously asked,” What answer shall I 
        take back to my people,” and warned prophetically, “It is us today, it will be you tomorrow.” 
        He became an icon of pre-war anti-fascism and was named “1935 Man of the Year” by Time magazine. 
        There were only six nations in the League that refused to recognise Italy’s occupation of 
        Ethiopia in 1937; New Zealand, USA, Mexico, China, Soviet Union and Spain. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        In 1941, Haile Selassie returned from exile after the Italians had been expelled with the 
        support of the British army now at war with Germany and Italy. The Ethiopian resistance 
        had been continuously active during the occupation. They are remembered as the patriotic 
        heroes and heroines of the ‘Arbegnoch’. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        After the war Haile Selassie set about modernising Ethiopia. He invited ordinary Italian 
        soldiers to remain and contribute to rebuilding Ethiopia. Many did, building respected 
        families and businesses with their Ethiopian wives. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Haile Selassie was a feudal monarch and most Ethiopians were peasant farmers living under 
        the power of local, landed aristocrats. His was the final word on major decisions but he 
        did face significant resistance to some of his reforms from the nobles and clergy especially 
        on tax and land matters. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        He took a special interest in education and appointed himself Minister of Education establishing
        the first university and many schools. An elected parliament was granted limited powers by the 1955 
        constitution which still maintained “the indisputable power of the monarch”.Haile Selassie helped 
        start the Organisation of African Unity in 1963 now known as the African Union and was its first 
        official chair person. The African Union headquarters continues to be in Addis Ababa leading to 
        Ethiopia being known as the diplomatic capital of Africa. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        In 1960 an attempted coup was crushed by the military and lacked popular support. However, there was sympathy 
        for change amongst students and some members of the educated elite. This is considered a major moment in recent 
        Ethiopian history as this was the first time the emperor’s absolute right to rule without the peoples’ consent was 
        questioned. The increased advocacy for the rights of the peasantry and poor, especially from students, spurred 
        Haile Selassie to speed up his reforms. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        Students were at the centre of calls for reform in the 1960s and ‘70s. Resentment grew amongst the rural poor at 
        the nobility’s successful resistance to land reform. Increasingly, Haile Selassie focused on foreign affairs and 
        left national affairs to his prime ministers. While his prestige grew internationally, there were growing problems at home. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
        A major famine in 1972 that killed up to 300,000 people was, at first, denied by the imperial government. There was widespread 
        outrage at this delay in asking the world for help. This famine was famously exposed to the outside world in 1973 by Jonathan 
        Dimbleby’s British television documentary called ‘The Unknown Famine’. History repeated itself in 1984 with Michael Buerk’s BBC 
        television reports from northern Ethiopia. Buerk's initial reports are credited with stimulating the international community 
        to respond on a massive scale including Band Aid and Live Aid.

        But, by 1974 Ethiopia was on the verge of revolution. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        Ethiopia's Communist Era (1974 – 91)
        The military coup on 22 September 1974 saw the aging emperor publicly humiliated by being 
        escorted from the Imperial Palace in a VW Beetle car. He was not initially harmed.
        A military council known as the Derg took power and summarily executed 59 members of the former imperial government. 
        Haile Selassie died in 1975. Many believe he was strangled in the basement of his palace by, or at the orders of, 
        Lt Col Mengistu Haile Mariam who then systematically murdered his rivals on the military council and established 
        himself as undisputed head of state by 1977. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        The new Marxist government made social reforms and nationalized the assets of the church, 
        aristocracy and landowners. Financially supported by the Soviet Union, Ethiopia became 
        a totalitarian state and greatly increased the size of its military. Cuban soldiers came 
        and fought alongside Ethiopian soldiers against some of the regional rebellions that 
        followed this upheaval. Ties with the USA were cut.
        In this milieu, in 1977, Somalia invaded the eastern Ethiopian territory known as the Ogaden. 
        This invasion was only repelled with a huge airlift of Soviet weapons and the support 
        of 17,000 Cuban soldiers. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        The Red Terror of 1977 – 78 was a time of extreme blood shed when hundreds of thousands 
        of accused enemies of the Derg were tortured and killed. Today, there is a museum to 
        this dark period in Addis Ababa. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        The regime’s overall brutality, the policy of forced villagization pushing farmers 
        onto collective farms, famine, collapse of the regime’s main sponsor the Soviet 
        Union and many regional rebellions led to the rebel military victory in 1991. </p>
          <p align = "justify">
        Mengistu fled to be the guest of his erstwhile supporter Mugabe in Zimbabwe.
        He still lives there despite being found guilty of genocide by Ethiopian courts. 
        Mengistu is considered responsible for the deaths of up to 2,000,000 Ethiopians. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Ethiopia – A Federal Democratic Republic (from 1991)
        In 1991 an alliance of northern rebel groups militarily defeated the Derg’s 
        forces which had been weakened by the collapse of the Soviet Union. 
        In a referendum that followed this victory, Eritrea voted for full independence 
        from Ethiopia and became an independent state in 1993 after about 30 years of 
        guerrilla war. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        The 1994 constitution created the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia. 
        In 1995 Prime Minister Meles Zenawi and a multiparty parliament were elected 
        in the first of the 5 yearly elections that have followed. </p>
       <p align = "justify">
        The federation consists of 14 national states reflecting ethnic and cultural territories. 
        The elected state governments are responsible for everything except defence, 
        foreign affairs and economic policy. Addis Ababa and Dire Dawa are two federal 
        city-states with their own government. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Market reforms were introduced and many government businesses were privatized with 
        some notable exceptions including the successful and efficiently run Ethio – Telecom, 
        Ethiopian Airlines and The Commercial Bank of Ethiopia. There are now many private banks. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Massive state investment in infrastructure such as roads and hydroelectricity generation 
        has attracted growing levels of foreign investment. Marxist era land reform saw all 
        land go into government ownership and this is still the case. More than 40 universities 
        have been built across the country to offer higher education to the 50% of Ethiopians 
        that are aged below 18. A key challenge is finding employment for the burgeoning 
        numbers of skilled graduates. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
         Ethiopia is seen as a major African economic success story in recent years starting 
         from a low base as one of the poorest countries on the continent. The World Bank 
         reports that in 2000, 56% of the population lived on less than US$ 1.25 per day. 
         This was reduced to 30% by 2011.

        From 2004 to 2014 economic growth has averaged 10.8%. </p>

        Addis Ababa recently opened the first urban, electric powered, light rail system 
        anywhere in Africa. The 800 km Addis Ababa to the port of Djibouti railway line has 
        been electrified and rebuilt for fast trains. Djibouti is a small independent 
        state and all of landlocked Ethiopia’s maritime exports and imports pass through this port. </p>

        The Grand Ethiopian Renaissance Dam, under construction since 2011, on the Blue Nile 
        will be the largest hydroelectric dam in Africa and 7th largest in the world. Egypt 
        feared control of the head waters of the Blue Nile which carries 80% of the water in 
        the Nile river that flows on to Egypt. This resulted in the Ethiopian government having 
        difficulty gaining finance for the USD 5 billion project. Despite this, Ethiopia 
        pressed ahead and largely financed the project itself. Egypt has since signed an agreement 
        with the Ethiopia. </p>

        Ethiopia is rapidly developing into a middle income country. Many members of the

        after years of difficulties, is a testament to the courage and resilience of her people. 
        Despite the challenges faced by this great nation, there is a palpable sense of positivity 
        and optimism amongst the people. This is not only in economic terms but in the proud 
        traditional culture and blossoming of contemporary creativity in cinema, theatre, 
        visual arts and music. Ethiopia is just starting to hit its stride which makes it a great time to visit.

    <p align = "justify">Ethiopia is located in the Horn of Africa. It is bordered by Eritrea in the north. 
      Djibouti and Somalia is the east. Sudan and South Sudan in the west, and Kenya in the south. Ethiopia
      has a high centeral plateau that various from 1,290 to 3,000 m(4,232 to 9843 ft) bove seal level, with 
      the highest mountain reaching 4620 m (15,157 ft). Elevation is generally highest just before the point 
      of descent to the Great Rift Vally, which splits the plateau diagonally. A number of rivers cross the plateau; 
      notable the Blue Nile rising from Lake Tana. The plateau gradually slops to the lowland of Sudan on the 
      west and Somali-inhabitated plains to the east. Ethiopian westernmost locality is Pibor river opposit the 
      Sudanes village of Denjok. its easternmost locality lies along the easter border of Dollo Zone opposit Puntland
      and Galmudug states.

    <p align = "justify">
      Physical features Between the the vally of Upper Nile and Ethiopia's border with Sundan and South Sudan is
      a region of elevated plateau from which rise the various tablelands and mountains that constitute the Ethiopian
      Highlands. On nearly every side. the walls of the plateaus rise abruptly from the plains. constituting outer 
      mountain chains. The highlands are thus a clearly marked geographic division. In Eritrea, the eastern wall of
      this plateau runs parallel to the Red Sea from Ras Kasar (18 degree N) to Annesely Bay (also knownas the Bay 
      of Zula)(15degree N). It then turns due to south into Ethiopia and follows closely the line of 40 degree E 
      form some 600 km(373mi). About 9 degree N there is a break in the wall, through which the Awash River flow 
      eastward. The main range at this point trends southwest, whil e south of the Awash Valley, which is some 
      1,000m(3,281 ft) below the level of mountains, another massif rises in a diret line of south. This second 
      range sends a chain (The Almar Mountains ) eastward toward Gulf of Aden. The two chief easten rangs maintain
      a parallel course south my west, with a broad upland valley in between  - in which valley are a series of lakes- to 
      about 3 degree N, the outer(eastern) spurs of the plateau still keeping along the line of 40 degree E 
      The southern escarpment of the plateau is highly irregular, but has a general direction northwest and southeast
       from 6degree N to 3 degree N. </P>

      It overlooks the depression in which is Lake Turkana and-east of that lie - the southern Debub Omo Zone (part of the larger South Nations, Nationalities, and Peoples of Region).
      The western wall of plateau from 6 degree N to 11 degaree N is well marked and precipitous. North of 11 degree N the hills turn more to east and fall more gradually to the East 
      Sudanian savana plains at their base. On its northern face, the plateau falls in terraces to the level of the eastern Sudan.
      The easten escarpment is the best defined to these outer ranges.It has a mean height of 2,100 to 2,400 m(6,890 to 7,874 ft), and in 
      many places rises almost perpendicularly from the plain. Narrow and deep clefs, through which descend mountain torrents that lose themselves in the sandy soil of the Eritrean coast, afford means of 
      reaching the plateau, or the easier routhe through the Awash Valley may be chosen.

      On surmounting this rocky barrier, the travller finds that the encircling rampart rises little above the normal level of the plateau.
      the physical aspect of the highlands are impressive. the northern portion lies mainly between 10 degree and 15 degree N. It consists of a huge mass of Archaean rocks with a mean hehight of 
      2,000 to 2.2000 m(6,562 to 7,218 ft) above sea level, and is flooded in a dep central depression by the waters
      of Lake Tana. Above the plateau rise several irrgular and generally ill-defind mountain ranges which attain 
      attitude of from 3,700 m(12,139 ft) to just under 4,600 m(15,092 ft). Many of the mountains are of unusual shape. </P>

      Characters of the country are the enormous fissures which divide ti, formed over time by the erosive action of water. the are the valleys of the rivers, which rising on the uplands or mountain sides, have cut their way
      to the surrounding lowlands. Some of the valleys are of considerable width; in other case the opposit walls
      of the gorges are but two or three hunedred meters part and fall almost vertically thousands of meters
      representing an erosion of many hundred thounds cubic meters of hard rock. One result of the action of

                She stayed and learned from him for six months.   
                On the last night of her visit, he tricked her into his bed, and she became pregnant. 
                She returned to her kingdom, where she bore Solomon a son, Menilek. Menilek I was made 
                king by his father, thus founding the royal Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia, which ruled
                until the deposition of Haile Selassie I in 1974. </p>
                  <h4>Menelik I</h4>

                <p align = "justify">
                  Menelik I took leadership as the first emperor of Ethiopia around 950 BC after claiming a right 
                  to the position based on his alleged relation to significant Ethiopian royalty. An ancient Ethiopian 
                  text, the Kebra Negast, contains a story claiming that the Biblical figures the Queen of Sheba and King 
                  Solomon bore a son following the queen's journey from Ethiopia to Jerusalem where she sought to experience 
                  the king's wisdom. Menelik I asserted that he was the son of the Queen of Sheba and King Solomon and that 
                  Biblical text affirmed his sole right to rule over Ethiopia. According to tradition, Menelik I brought the 
                  Ark of the Covenant to Ethiopia where it remains today. As the founder of the Solomonic dynasty of Ethiopia, 
                  Menelik I established some of the most significant Christian traditions that would persist and evolve over time. 
                  He also had several sons which led to the establishment of familial rule and the founding of the first empire 
                  of Ethiopia.</p>

                  <p align = "justify">Fourth-century Emperor Ezana is considered to be the greatest Ethiopian ruler of the Axumite Empire and 
                    is considered one of Ethiopia's national heroes to this day. During his rule, Ezana made the decision to 
                    convert the empire to Christianity, which he hoped would achieve his goal of unifying the diverse peoples of 
                    the Axumite Empire as well as strengthening existing trade relations with the Roman Empire. During this time, 
                    many Christian churches were built in prominent cities like Aksum and Adulis to meet the religious and spiritual 
                    needs of Aksumites. In order to support the empire's increasingly complex and profitable economy, Aksum developed
                    a sophisticated coinage system. Emperor Ezana replaced the original design of coins with one that incorporated 
                    the Christian cross. In addition to his religious pursuits, Ezana expanded the Kingdom of Axum by waging and 
                    winning wars against surrounding territories. </p>
                    <p align = "justify">
                    Aksum's influence had begun to weaken by the conclusion of the 8th century due to a variety of factors including 
                    the migration of nomads into the area, a loss of influence in Arabia, and environmental factors that prevented 
                    the kingdom from successfully growing crops.</p>

                    <p align = "justify">Following the Axum dynasty, the Zagwe dynasty began in the 9th or 10th century. This was the first Ethiopian 
                      dynasty that did not directly claim heritage from King Solomon. The Zagwe dynasty's most prominent king was 
                      Lalibela, who is credited with the building of 11 monolithic churches throughout the region. These churches 
                      drew inspiration from the previous dynasty and were carved entirely out of mountain rock. Lalibela was influenced 
                      to create these structures due to the increasing prevalence of Islam and other religions in surrounding regions. 
                      These large Christian churches, referred to by King Lalibela as the "New Jerusalem", affirmed the dynasty's distinctly 
                      Christian identity at a time when Muslim conflicts near Ethiopia prevented Christians from traveling to the holy 
                      land of Jerusalem. To this day, the churches erected by King Lalibela remain largely intact and serve as homes for 
                      priests and monks. The churches are also popular pilgrimage sites for Ethiopian Christians who now revere 
                      Lalibela as a saint.</p>

                  who ignored a series of letters he sent to the likes of Queen Victoria. Finally, the British sent a 
                  huge military expedition from India complete with war elephants under General Napier to free the European 
                  hostages taken by Tewedros. Tewedros shot himself rather than surrender his mountain fortress of Magdala.

                country to become a world power by furthering the social and cultural development of the nation and obtaining 
                great influence in international politics. However, civil and international conflicts would threaten the country 
                throughout Selassie's rule. Ongoing tensions between Ethiopia and Italy came to a head in 1935 when they escalated 
                into open conflict and the attempted invasion of Ethiopia. Selassie was exiled during this time which left the citizens 
                of Ethiopia without support from their leader. The conflict ended in 1940 when Britain assisted Ethiopia in ousting 
                Italian aggressors from their country during World War II.</p>

         Ethiopian dress is quite different from the multi-coloured traditions of people in 
         West Africa for example. It also varies greatly according to the tribes and areas concerned. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
         The Amhara people, who form the dominant group on the high central plateau, wear predominantly white.  
         Men wear tunics or shawls worn over the shoulders while white dresses and wraps are worn by women. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
         Special occasions see the best embroidered dresses being paraded by the ladies, accompanied by complex 
         hairstyles and jewellery. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
         Amid the relative quietness of the national costume, the brightly coloured robes of the many priests 
         stand out, often accompanied in public ceremonies by large embroidered parasols that sparkle in the 
         sunshine with their gold and silver threads.</p>
         <p align = "justify">In other parts of Ethiopia, particularly the southern tribes in the Rift Valley, dress is much more 
         primitive and basic. The men of the Surma tribe, for example, still wear nothing apart from a cloth 
         that is knotted over one shoulder and hangs down over the body. Scarification is a common feature of 
         many of the lowland tribes. </p>
         <p align = "justify">
         While the national dress is displayed at religious festivals and weddings, more day-today outfits 
         include simple skirts, shirts and trousers, some of them handouts from international charities. </p>
            <p align = "justify">
         Indeed, western attire is more commonly being worn, particularly in urban areas where young Ethiopians

        While the outside world may think famine is a permanent concern in Ethiopia, the majority of the

        The staple fare of the Ethiopian home is injera, a pancake usually made from a locally grown cereal

        cooked over a large open wood fire. A typical meal will consist of a large injera, the size of a round 
        coffee table, on which other dishes are placed such as boiled vegetables, spicy sauces, milk curds and 
        on special days, chicken, beef, lamb or fish.

        St Yared is the Ethiopian patron saint of church music and, in every church, music serves to give atmosphere

        along with the beating of the prayer sticks and the clapping of hands. </p>

        Out in the community, musical instruments play a social and entertaining role. The single-stringed masenko is 
        played by minstrels who sing of life around them and invent, calypso-like, topical verses on the spot. 
        The krar is a lyre-like plucked instrument with 5 or 6 strings while the begenna is the portable harp.

        In addition to more traditional styles, Ethiopians also listen to popular music where the country boasts 
        a whole host of contemporary artists, some of whom are internationally recognised such as Gigi.
              
        Mainstream music from the West has also infiltrated Ethiopian culture where you can hear Lady Gaga and Justin

   However Haile Sellasie I (regined 1930 - 74) gave audiances to Muslim leaders and made overtures in responses 
   to their concerns, and under the Derg regime(1974 - 91) even more was done to give at least symbolic parity to 
   the two faiths.
   Neverthless, the perception of Ethiopia as "an island of Christianity in sea of Islam" has continued to prevail among both

        The flag of Ethiopia (Amharic: የኢትዮጵያ ሰንደቅ ዐላማ, romanized: Ye-Ītyōṗṗyā sändäq ʿälama) is the national flag of 
        Ethiopia. It consists of a green, yellow, and red tricolour with the national emblem, a golden pentagram on a 
        blue disc, superimposed at the center. While the colors green, yellow, and red in combination held symbolic 
        importance since at least the early 17th century, the modern tricolour was first adopted on 11 October 1897 by 
        Menelik II, and the present flag on 31 October 1996. 
        
      </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        The colors of green, yellow and red were used for the flag of the Ethiopian Empire in 1914. 
        On 11 October 1897, a year after Ethiopia decisively defeated the Kingdom of Italy at the Battle of Adwa, 
        emperor Menelik II ordered the three pennants combined in a rectangular tricolour from top to bottom of red, 
        yellow, and green with the first letter of his own name (the Amharic letter "ም") on the central stripe.          
        The letter of Menelik's name was removed from the flag after his death in 1913. For unknown reasons, the colour 
        order was flipped - with green on top, red on the bottom, and the yellow remaining in place.
        The flag's tricolour scheme has existed since the early 19th century, and the colours red, yellow, and green 
        arried special importance prior to that. To commemorate its adoption in 1897, Ethiopia celebrates Flag Day 
        on the first Monday of the month of Tikimt (September–October).</p>

        <p align = "justify">
         The royal flag often featured the emblem of a Lion of Judah, a crowned lion carrying a cross centered in 
         the banner's yellow midsection. The flag is understood to be a link between the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo 
         Church, the peoples, and the nation that was united. The processional cross carried by the lion was the former 
         flag or symbol of Ethiopia, and has likewise been in use since at least the early 17th century.
         Whilst red is currently featured at the bottom of the horizontal tricolour, this was reversed until the mid-19th 
         century. What the colors symbolise varies depending on point of view. However, generally, red represents the blood 
         spilled in defense of Ethiopia; yellow represents peace and harmony between Ethiopia's various ethnic and religious 
         groups; and green is said to symbolise hope, or the land and its fertility.[citation needed] The colors had 
         historically been used by the Ethiopian church prior to their adoption as the colors of the state for unknown 
         reasons, but likely due to them being easy to produce and common in the Ethiopian landscape.[10] Two French travelers 
         in the 19th century, Ferret and Joseph Galinier, said "red, green and yellow are the main colours of manuscript 
         illuminations. </p>

             <p align = "justify">
              Upon gaining independence from colonial rule, several newly-established countries in Africa adopted 
              these three colors in homage to Ethiopia's resistance against foreign occupation. When adopted by 
              Pan-Africanist polities and organisations for their activities, the colours are often referred to as
              the Pan-African colours.

              <p align = "justify">
                Prior to 1996, the plain green, yellow and red banner was commonly used as a civil flag. Although a number of 
                different emblems were used by the government since 1974, flags with emblems were uncommonly used in public 
                outside of government usage. The basic colour schematic has remained constant. </p>
                <p align = "justify">
                The star is yellow on a blue disc which overlaps the green and red stripes. The star testifies to Ethiopia's 
                bright future, while the yellow rays which it emits are equidistant and are said to represent the equality of 
                all Ethiopians regardless of race, creed, or sex. In recent years, the government of Ethiopia has taken a 
                conscious effort to increase the usage of the flag with the emblem, which had been seen far less than the 
                plain tricolour. As the plain tricolour was used and seen far more often than either the flag of the Derg 
                or the Lion of Judah flag, this was considered unusual. </p>

                In 2009, the Parliament of Ethiopia passed Proclamation 654/2009 (The Federal Flag Proclamation),

                "to deface the Flag by writing or displaying signs, [sic] symbols, emblems or picture [sic]", or "to prepare 
                or use the Flag without the proper order of its colors and size or its Emblem."[20] While most offenses were 
                punishable by a fine of "3000 birr or rigorous imprisonment up to one year," the first offense, mandating the 
                usage of the emblem, received an increased penalty of "5000 birr or rigorous imprisonment up to one year and six
                 months. This replaced the 1996 Flag Proclamation, which had made no mention of offenses or penaltie

        Christian marriages, mainly in Tigray and Amhara regions, are often arranged by the

        virginity is highly valued and pride in Christian marriage, with the whole family being 
        shamed if the bride is not virgin at marriage. Rural women in particular tend to marry at 
        a very young age than their husbands. In the past it used to be the custom for the bridegroom 
        to be 30 years of age when getting married following the biblical example of Christ who waited 
        until he was 30 years of age before beginning his public ministry. </p>
        <p align = "justify">
        Traditionally the groom's parents search for a bride for their son. Before they make any contact 
        with the bride's parents they investigate to make sure that the famalies are not related by blood. 
        In the past they researched back seven generations, but now five generations is acceptable. 
        Once this has been done the boy's parents then make contact with the prespective bride's parents 
        through a mediator. The mediator goes to the home of the potential bride and asks if their daughter 
        will marry the son of the other parents. 
        The bride's parents often impose conditions and the mediator will take the message to the groom's parents, 
        then arrange a date 
        for both parents to meet at a mutually convenient location. </p>

        When the parents have reached an agreement, the man and woman get engaged. The parents then

        other on their wedding day. Both parents prepare food and drink for the wedding and invite guests. 
        The groom goes to the bride's house to take his future wife to be. The wedding ceremony starts 
        with dances and music and the bride's parents give the groom a dowry, in most case money and cattle. 
        At the end of the ceremony the groom takes his bride to his parents' house. The groom takes the bride's 
        virginity during the first three days after the marriage. The honeymoon will last between one week to 
        three months dependant on the groom's parents' economic circumstances. This takes place at the husband's 
        parents' house and often the best man/men will also be present. After the honeymoon the couple return to 
        the house of the bride's parents where they stay together for a set time, again with the best man/men present. 
        During the honeymoon, the bride is not allowed to go out during the day; she is only allowed to go out after 
        sunset. <p>

          In 1889, the Italians signed the Treaty of Wuchale with the then King Menelik of Shewa. The treaty, signed after the Italian occupation of Eritrea, 
          recognized Italy's claim over the coastal colony. In it, Italy also promised to provide financial assistance and military supplies. A dispute later 
          arose over the interpretation of the two versions of the document. The Italian-language version of the disputed Article 17 of the treaty stated that 
          the Emperor of Ethiopia was obliged to conduct all foreign affairs through Italian authorities, effectively making Ethiopia a protectorate of the Kingdom 
          of Italy. The Amharic version of the article, however, stated that the Emperor could use the good offices of the Kingdom of Italy in his relations with 
          foreign nations if he wished. However, the Italian diplomats claimed that the original Amharic text included the clause and that Menelik II knowingly 
          signed a modified copy of the Treaty.
        </p>
        <p align = "justify">
          The Italian government decided on a military solution to force Ethiopia to abide by the Italian version of 
          the treaty. As a result, Italy and Ethiopia came into confrontation, in what was later to be known as the 
          First Italo-Ethiopian War. In December 1894, Bahta Hagos led a rebellion against the Italians in Akele Guzai, 
          in what was then Italian controlled Eritrea. Units of General Oreste Baratieri's army under Major Pietro Toselli 
          crushed the rebellion and killed Bahta. The Italian army then occupied the Tigrayan capital, Adwa. In January 
          1895, Baratieri's army went on to defeat Ras Mengesha Yohannes in the Battle of Coatit, forcing Mengesha to retreat 
          further south.
        </p>
        <p align = "justify">By late 1895, Italian forces had advanced deep into Ethiopian territory. On 7 December 
          1895, Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael, Fitawrari Gebeyehu and Ras Mengesha Yohannes commanding a larger Ethiopian group of
           Menelik's vanguard annihilated a small Italian unit at the Battle of Amba Alagi. The Italians were then forced to withdraw to more defensible
            positions in Tigray Province, where the two main armies faced each other. By late February 1896, supplies on both sides were running low. General Oreste Baratieri, commander of the Italian forces, knew the Ethiopian forces had been living off the land, and once the supplies of the local peasants were exhausted, Emperor Menelik II's army would begin to melt away. However, the Italian government insisted that General Baratieri act.</p>
        <p align = "justify">On the evening of 29 February, Baratieri, about to be replaced by a new governor, General Baldissera, met with his generals Matteo Albertone, Giuseppe Arimondi, Vittorio Dabormida, and Giuseppe Ellena, concerning their next steps. He opened the meeting on a negative note, revealing to his brigadiers that provisions would be exhausted in less than five days, and suggested retreating, perhaps as far back as Asmara. His subordinates argued forcefully for an attack, insisting that to retreat at this point would only worsen the poor morale.[15] Dabormida exclaimed, "Italy would prefer the loss of two or three thousand men to a dishonorable retreat." Baratieri delayed making a decision for a few more hours, claiming that he needed to wait for some last-minute intelligence, but in the end announced that the attack would start the next morning at 9:00am.[16] His troops began their march to their starting positions shortly after midnight.</p>

        <p align = "justify">
          Estimates for the Ethiopian forces under Menelik range from a low of 73,000 to a high of over 120,000, 
          outnumbering the Italians by an estimated five or six times.[18] The forces were divided among Emperor 
          Menelik, Empress Taytu Betul, Ras Wale Betul, Ras Mengesha Atikem, Ras Mengesha Yohannes, Ras Alula 
          Engida (Abba Nega), Ras Mikael of Wollo, Ras Makonnen Wolde Mikael,Fitawrari Habte Giyorgis, Fitawrari
          Gebeyyehu, and Negus Tekle Haymanot Tessemma. In addition, the armies were followed by a similar 
          number of camp followers who supplied the army, as had been done for centuries. Most of the army consisted 
          of riflemen, a significant percentage of whom were in Menelik's reserve; however, there were also a significant 
          number of cavalry and infantry only armed with lances (those with lances were referred to as "lancer servants").
          The Kuban Cossack army officer N. S. Leontiev who visited Ethiopia in 1895, according to some sources, led a 
          small team of Russian advisers and volunteers. Other sources assert that Leontiev did not in fact 
          participate in the battle, rather he visited Ethiopia first unofficially in January 1895, and then officially 
          as a representative of Russia in August 1895, but then left later that year, returning only after the Battle 
          of Adwa.

        <p align = "justify"><b>Ethnic composition of the Ethiopian army</b> <br>
          At the Battle of Adwa, Ethiopian fighters from all parts of the country rallied to the cause and took up 
          positions on the battlefield that allowed them to come to each other's aid during combat. Armies who participated 
          in the battle includes Tekle Haymanot's Amhara infantry and cavalry; Ras Mengesha’s Tigrayan army; Ras Mikael’s Oromo cavalry; 
          Ras Makonnen's Harar army that composed of Amhara and Gurage infantry and Oromo cavalry; Wag-shum Gwangul's Agew and 
          Amhara infantry from Wag and Lasta. Fitawrari Tekle led the Wellega Oromo cavalry while Ras Gugsa Olié's army was composed of 
          Amharas from Semien and Quara. Empress Taytu Bitul led her own Begemder Amhara and Yejju fighters. The Fitawrari's army, normally 
          the leader of the advanced guard, was commanded by Fitawrari Gebeyehu. The mehal sefari or central fighting unit mostly included 
          Shewan Amhara infantry and Mecha-Tulama Oromo cavalry. The Ethiopian army at Adwa was, therefore, a mosaic of various ethnic groups 
          and tribes that marched north for a common, national cause
        </p>
        <p align = "justify"> <b>Italian forces</b> <br>
          The Italian army consisted of four brigades, totaling 17,978 troops with fifty-six artillery pieces.           
          However, it is likely that fewer fought in the actual battle on the Italian side: Harold Marcus notes that 
          "several thousand" soldiers were needed in support roles and to guard the lines of communication to the rear. 
          He accordingly estimates that the Italian force at Adwa consisted of 14,923 effective combat troops.
          One brigade under General Albertone was made up of Eritrean Ascari led by Italian officers.
          The remaining three brigades were Italian units under Brigadiers Dabormida, Ellena and Arimondi. 
          While these included elite Bersaglieri and Alpini units, a large proportion of the troops were inexperienced 
          conscripts recently drafted from metropolitan regiments in Italy into newly formed "d'Africa" battalions 
          for service in Africa. Additionally, a limited number of troops were from the Cacciatori d'Africa; units 
          permanently serving in Africa and in part recruited from Italian settlers

        <b>1. Lucy (Australopithecus)</b>
        commonly known as Lucy, is a collection of several hundred pieces of fossilized bone representing 40 percent
        of a female of the hominin species Australopithecus afarensis. In Ethiopia, the assembly is also known as
        Dinkinesh (ድንቅ ነሽ), which means "you are marvelous" in Amharic. Lucy was discovered in 1974 in Africa, at 
        Hadar, a site in the Awash Valley of the Afar Triangle in Ethiopia, by paleoanthropologist Donald Johanson of 
        the Cleveland Museum of Natural History.

      </p>
       <p align = "justify">
      The Lucy specimen is an early australopithecine and is dated to about 3.2 million years ago. The skeleton 
      presents a small skull akin to that of non-hominin apes, plus evidence of a walking-gait that was bipedal 
      and upright, akin to that of humans (and other hominins); this combination supports the view of human evolution 
      that bipedalism preceded increase in brain size.[4][5] A 2016 study proposes that Australopithecus afarensis was
      also to a large extent tree-dwelling, though the extent of this is debated. </p>
      <p align = "justify">
      "Lucy" acquired her name from the 1967 song "Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds" by the Beatles, which was played 
      loudly and repeatedly in the expedition camp all evening after the excavation team's first day of work on the 
      recovery site. After public announcement of the discovery, Lucy captured much public interest, becoming a household 
      name at the time. </p>
     <p align = "justify">
     Lucy became famous worldwide, and the story of her discovery and reconstruction was published in a book by 
     Johanson. Beginning in 2007, the fossil assembly and associated artifacts were exhibited publicly in an extended 
     six-year tour of the United States; the exhibition was called Lucy's Legacy: The Hidden Treasures of Ethiopia. 
     There was discussion of the risks of damage to the unique fossils, and other museums preferred to display casts 
     of the fossil assembly.[8] The original fossils were returned to Ethiopia in 2013, and subsequent exhibitions have 
     used casts. </p>
